# Configure keyboard settings.
#
# This script is run in three contexts:
#
# * `.xinitrc` (automatic): Applies to all keyboards plugged in at boot-time.
# * `dm-multihead` (automatic): Applies to all keyboards plugged in when
#   `dm-multihead` is run.
# * Manually: When a keyboard is hotplugged (after `.xinitrc` has run), the
#   script must be run manually to apply the keyboard settings.
